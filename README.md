# README

This web application exists to demonstrate Sentry.io's SDKs for error monitoring.
It is a multi-tenant ecommerce platform built with a React frontend and a Rails backend.
The goal is to demonstrate segmented, compartmentalized integration, possibly at multiple points within one app.

As this application is being developed, it will serve as a playground where various different parts of the app can break
in different ways, on different days. In theory, though, it should be possible for someone to run a working web store with
this application.
